*** bixygau (convert jbovlaste XML dump to json)

You generally don't need this, as this tool has built-in dictionary
(jbo-en) included in the binary. If you want to customize or use the
dictionary for other languages, you can use this tool.

Instructions:

1. Download the export from [[http://jbovlaste.lojban.org/export/xml.html][here]].
2. Run =gerytci -d <output_filename> <input_xml_filename>=; Note that
   You must specify =-d= option the output location of the generated
   dict file.
3. Wait until it finishes. The generation process will take a few minutes.
